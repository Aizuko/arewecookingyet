ingredients:
  - 1 cup flour
  - 1 cup yellow cornmeal
  - 1/2 cup sugar
  - 3 1/2 tsp baking powder
  - 1 cup milk
  - 1/3 vegetable oil
  - 1 large egg
directions:
  1: Whisk all ingredients together
  2: Preheat oven to 400F
  3: Bake in a 9 inch round pan for 20-25 minutes
notes: >
  Baking time seems to be on the higher end. Almost too sweet with even just
  half a cup of sugar, so less is fine.
