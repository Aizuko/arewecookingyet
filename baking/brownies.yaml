ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 cups flour
  - 1 cup white sugar
  - 1 cup (2 sticks) melted butter
  - 4 eggs
  - 1/2 cup cocoa powder
  - 1/2 tsp baking powder
directions:
  1: Mix everything together
  2: Place in 7 x 11\" tray (glass won't need oil)
  3: Bake at 350F for 25mins or until top is dry
notes: >
  4 eggs make this a very dense brownie. Original recipe called for nuts as
  toppings, which would probably taste much better. Original recipe uses 2 cups
  of sugar. You can use 1, but it is much more bland.
