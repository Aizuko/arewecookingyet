  - 1 tsp hot chilli powder
  - 4 tbsp of finely chopped cilantro
  - 3 tbsp oil
  - 2 tbsp lime juice
directions:
  1: Cook the beans by boiling. Skip this step if using cans
  2: Sautee onions in 2 tbsp of oil
  3: Mash the cooked beans. They don't have to be perfectly creamy
  4: Add bean paste in roughly 2 cup batches to frying onions
  5: Mix in chilli powder
  6: Take off heat. Mix in cilantro
notes: >
  You can use any type of beans, I used black beans. Pinto are more
  "traditional". You can probably use up to 3 cups of onions, any types works.
  Mostly fine without the lime juice.
