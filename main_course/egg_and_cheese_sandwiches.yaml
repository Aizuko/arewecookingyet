source: Akemi
ingredients:
  - 4 slices of bread
  - 1-2 slices of cheese, depending on bread size
  - 2 large eggs
  - 1/4 tsp hot chilli powder
directions:
  1: Crack both eggs on a large plate
  2: Cover and heat in microwave for about 80s, or until egg whites aren't fluid
  3: >
    Add microwaved egg, half the cheese, and half the chilli powder to each
    sandwich
  4: Heat in microwave for about 40s
notes: >
  Adjust chilli powder to your spice tolerance. Microwaves significantly vary
  in power, so cook in step 2 until the eggs aren't raw. This recipe is very
  minimal, targeting busy students, though vegetables would likely improve it
